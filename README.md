# Diy-Keyboard-
Diy Keyboard project using ADF Teensy 2.0/3.2

Ok, quick run down on me....
So I’m a pretty practical hands on sort of dude, designing, fabricating, machining, soldering, welding etc... Hardware I can fix, software I mostly left to someone else!

My programming experience is near zero by today’s standard... I did a lot of BASIC programming back in the good’ol days of Tron and Weird science (and Yes, i still have the bra hat!)... 
Ya know when a floppy disk was 5.25”! Amstrad, Atari, Amiga and Acorn ruled the world before the devil incarnate (late Steve Jobs) released this weird new thing with a picture of a half eaten stripy apple on it back in the late 70’s; that was going to ‘revolutionise’ the industry not rip it in two!
I also taught myself enough HTML in 2000-2001 when I needed to make a clan website for AvP2 (ya know the good one, before they made a complete FUBAR of the remake a couple of years back) if anyone remembers that it was the ‘Evac Legends’ and I am the one and only Stoned_Stew_UK[L][LSD] Ok... Yea... So i was mostly stoned back then too!
So back to modern day:
Between the decades and ounces of weed that have passed I don't remember a great deal of BASIC anymore and tbh I don’t recall a single line of HTML! Kinda surprises myself that I managed to cobble together a fully functioning bug free website with more funky stuff going on than most other sites around at that time! Shame it faded away to dust as does everything else with time.... Christ, enough with the philosophical puke... On to why I'm here already!

Right, so I thought Raspberry Pi was something that you had for desert with custard... Now I here there are these Teensy things all over. Yep... that's right I was expecting XXX content!
OK, no I didn't think that and yes I knew the Raspberry Pi wasn't food, But that does pretty much sum up my working knowledge of them!

So I'm here to make myself a new keyboard and use something like the Teensy 2.0 or 3.2 as the controller! The hardware part I can deal with thats not the issue! My issue is the software for the teensy doodad that controls it. Everything I've read has pointed to Github for resources and scripts and such! Hense why I'm here.

There are a couple of extra bits that I would be looking to add to my finished keyboard that I haven't really seen added to others:

1. Keyboard controller (starting about 75-80% size, but possibly adding additional 'hotkeys' instead of macro's for heavily used commands)

2. Macro function (for game scripts etc)

3. 3 port usb hub (for mouse etc)

4. r/g/b led controller (controlled from the keyboard)

I think it would need to be the Teensy 3.2 as I believe there are no spare pins left on the 2.0 after the key matrix! Correct me if im wrong? 

And thats where I'm at just now....
